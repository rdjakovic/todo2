# Security Analysis Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the security requirements for analyzing and improving the Todo2 application's security posture. The analysis will identify vulnerabilities, assess current security measures, and provide recommendations for enhancing the application's security across all layers - frontend, backend, desktop, and infrastructure.
