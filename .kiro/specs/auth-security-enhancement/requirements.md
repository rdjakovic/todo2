# Authentication Security Enhancement Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the authentication security of the Todo2 application. The enhancement focuses on implementing rate limiting, account lockout mechanisms, improved error handling, and security logging to protect against brute force attacks and improve overall authentication security.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Rate Limiting and Account Lockout

**User Story:** As a security-conscious application, I want to implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms, so that I can protect against brute force attacks and unauthorized access attempts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user fails to authenticate 5 times THEN the system SHALL lock the account for 15 minutes
2. WHEN an account is locked THEN the system SHALL display a generic lockout message without revealing specific timing
3. WHEN the lockout period expires THEN the system SHALL automatically unlock the account
4. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL reset the failed attempt counter
5. WHEN rate limiting is active THEN the system SHALL prevent further authentication attempts until the lockout expires

### Requirement 2: Secure Error Handling

**User Story:** As a security-conscious application, I want to implement secure error handling, so that I can prevent information disclosure while maintaining user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display generic error messages that don't reveal whether email exists
2. WHEN an account is locked THEN the system SHALL not reveal the specific lockout duration
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly messages without exposing technical details
4. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information server-side for security monitoring
5. WHEN displaying errors THEN the system SHALL sanitize all error messages to prevent XSS

### Requirement 3: Security Logging and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want comprehensive security logging, so that I can monitor authentication attempts and detect potential security threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication attempts occur THEN the system SHALL log the attempt with timestamp and sanitized details
2. WHEN failed authentication attempts exceed threshold THEN the system SHALL log security events for monitoring
3. WHEN account lockouts occur THEN the system SHALL log lockout events with relevant context
4. WHEN successful authentication occurs THEN the system SHALL log successful login events
5. WHEN logging security events THEN the system SHALL sanitize sensitive information to prevent data exposure

### Requirement 4: Client-Side Security State Management

**User Story:** As a secure application, I want proper client-side security state management, so that I can maintain security context and prevent unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rate limiting is active THEN the system SHALL maintain lockout state in secure client storage
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL check for existing lockout state and enforce restrictions
3. WHEN lockout expires THEN the system SHALL clear the lockout state automatically
4. WHEN storing security state THEN the system SHALL use secure storage mechanisms that prevent tampering
5. WHEN managing security state THEN the system SHALL ensure state persistence across browser sessions

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Authentication Flow Security

**User Story:** As a user, I want a secure authentication experience, so that my account is protected while maintaining usability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entering credentials THEN the system SHALL validate input format before submission
2. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN the system SHALL prevent multiple concurrent authentication attempts
3. WHEN authentication completes THEN the system SHALL clear sensitive form data from memory
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL implement progressive delays for subsequent attempts
5. WHEN displaying authentication status THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback without revealing security details
