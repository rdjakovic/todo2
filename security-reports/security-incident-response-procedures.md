## Executive Summary

This document establishes comprehensive security incident response procedures for the Todo2 application. It defines incident classification, response workflows, communication protocols, and recovery procedures to ensure effective detection, containment, and resolution of security incidents.

### Scope and Applicability

These procedures apply to all security incidents affecting:
- Todo2 web application (React/TypeScript frontend)

  timestamp: Date;
  severity: 'CRITICAL' | 'HIGH' | 'MEDIUM' | 'LOW';
  category: IncidentCategory;
  source: string;
  description: string;
  indicators: SecurityIndicator[];
  automaticResponse?: AutomatedResponse;
}

interface SecurityIndicator {
  type: 'IP_ADDRESS' | 'USER_ID' | 'SESSION_ID' | 'URL' | 'USER_AGENT';
  value: string;
  confidence: number;
  context: Record<string, any>;
}
```

**Detection Rules**:
1. **Authentication Anomalies**
   - Multiple failed login attempts (>5 in 5 minutes)
   - Login from unusual locations
   - Concurrent sessions from different IPs
   - Authentication outside business hours

2. **Data Access Anomalies**
   - Bulk data access patterns
   - Access to sensitive data outside normal patterns
   - Database query anomalies
   - Unusual data export activities

3. **Application Anomalies**
   - High error rates
   - Unusual request patterns
   - Input validation failures
   - Performance anomalies

#### Manual Detection

**User Reports**
- Suspicious account activity
- Unexpected application behavior
- Phishing attempts
- Data integrity issues

**Security Assessments**

## Recovery and Post-Incident Activities

### Recovery Procedures

#### System Recovery Checklist

**Pre-Recovery Validation**:
- [ ] Threat completely eradicated
- [ ] Vulnerabilities patched
- [ ] Security controls updated
- [ ] Monitoring systems functional
- [ ] Backup systems verified

**Recovery Steps**:
1. **Gradual Service Restoration**
   ```typescript
   const recoveryPlan = {
     phase1: {
       description: 'Restore core authentication',
       duration: '30 minutes',
       rollbackTriggers: ['auth_failure_rate > 5%']
     },
     phase2: {
       description: 'Restore data access',
       duration: '1 hour',
       rollbackTriggers: ['data_integrity_failure', 'performance_degradation > 50%']
     },
     phase3: {
       description: 'Full service restoration',
       duration: '2 hours',
       rollbackTriggers: ['user_error_rate > 2%']
     }
   };
   ```

2. **Monitoring Enhancement**
   ```typescript
   // Enhanced monitoring during recovery
   const recoveryMonitoring = {
     authenticationMetrics: {
       successRate: { threshold: 95, alerting: true },
       responseTime: { threshold: 2000, alerting: true }
     },
     dataIntegrityMetrics: {
       checksumValidation: { frequency: '5min', alerting: true },
       relationshipValidation: { frequency: '15min', alerting: true }
     },
     performanceMetrics: {
       responseTime: { threshold: 3000, alerting: true },
       errorRate: { threshold: 1, alerting: true }
     }
   };
   ```

3. **User Communication**
   - Service restoration notifications
   - Security improvement updates
   - Recommended user actions

#### Data Recovery Procedures

**Database Recovery**:
```sql
-- Validate data integrity
SELECT 
  table_name,
  COUNT(*) as record_count,
  MAX(updated_at) as last_update
FROM information_schema.tables t
JOIN pg_stat_user_tables s ON t.table_name = s.relname
WHERE t.table_schema = 'public'
GROUP BY table_name;

-- Verify user data isolation
SELECT 
  user_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT list_id) as list_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT todo_id) as todo_count
FROM user_data_summary
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT list_id) > 100 OR COUNT(DISTINCT todo_id) > 1000;
```

**Local Storage Recovery**:
```typescript
// Validate and recover local storage
const recoverLocalStorage = async (): Promise<RecoveryReport> => {
  const recovery = {
    indexedDB: await validateIndexedDBIntegrity(),
    localStorage: await validateLocalStorageIntegrity(),
    sessionStorage: await validateSessionStorageIntegrity()
  };
  
  // Clear corrupted data
  if (!recovery.indexedDB.valid) {
    await clearIndexedDB();
    await resyncFromServer();
  }
  
  return recovery;
};
```

### Post-Incident Review

#### Incident Analysis Framework

**Timeline Reconstruction**:
```typescript
interface IncidentTimeline {
  events: TimelineEvent[];
  analysis: {
    detectionTime: number; // minutes from start to detection
    responseTime: number;  // minutes from detection to response
    containmentTime: number; // minutes from response to containment
    recoveryTime: number;   // minutes from containment to recovery
  };
  effectiveness: {
    detectionEffectiveness: 'EXCELLENT' | 'GOOD' | 'FAIR' | 'POOR';
    responseEffectiveness: 'EXCELLENT' | 'GOOD' | 'FAIR' | 'POOR';
    communicationEffectiveness: 'EXCELLENT' | 'GOOD' | 'FAIR' | 'POOR';
  };
}
```

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Technical Root Causes**
   - Vulnerability analysis
   - Configuration issues
   - Process failures
   - Human errors

2. **Process Root Causes**
   - Detection delays
   - Response coordination issues
   - Communication failures
   - Training gaps

3. **Organizational Root Causes**

}

class IncidentResponseTester {
  async runSimulation(simulation: IncidentSimulation): Promise<TestResults> {
    // Trigger simulated incident
    await this.triggerIncident(simulation.triggers);
    
    // Monitor response
    const response = await this.monitorResponse(simulation.expectedResponse);
    
    // Evaluate effectiveness
    return this.evaluateResponse(response, simulation.successCriteria);
  }
}
```
