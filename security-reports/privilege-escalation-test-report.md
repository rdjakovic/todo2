# Privilege Escalation Security Test Report

**Generated:** 2025-07-27T05:17:17.699Z  
**Application:** Todo2 Tauri Desktop Application  
**Test Type:** Privilege Escalation Vulnerability Assessment

## Test Overview

This report outlines the privilege escalation security tests that should be performed on the Todo2 application. These tests are designed to identify potential vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges or access unauthorized resources.

## Test Categories

### 1. Directory Traversal Tests
**Risk Level:** High  
**Description:** Tests for path traversal vulnerabilities in the storage path configuration.  
**Test Function:** `testDirectoryTraversal()`

**Test Scenarios:**
- Attempts to set storage paths outside the application directory
- Tests various path traversal payloads (../, ..\, etc.)
- Validates path sanitization and access controls

### 2. Arbitrary File Access Tests
**Risk Level:** Critical  
**Description:** Tests for unauthorized file system access capabilities.  
**Test Function:** `testArbitraryFileAccess()`

**Test Scenarios:**
- Attempts to access system directories (/etc, C:\Windows\System32)
- Tests writing to sensitive locations
- Validates file access permissions and restrictions

### 3. Configuration Tampering Tests
**Risk Level:** Medium  
**Description:** Tests for configuration manipulation vulnerabilities.  
**Test Function:** `testConfigurationTampering()`

**Test Scenarios:**
- Theme manipulation with malicious payloads
- Configuration injection attacks
- Persistent configuration tampering

### 4. State Manipulation Tests
**Risk Level:** Medium  
**Description:** Tests for application state manipulation and race conditions.  
**Test Function:** `testStateManipulation()`

**Test Scenarios:**
- Rapid state changes to test for race conditions
- State persistence across operations
- Concurrent access testing

### 5. Path Traversal in File Operations
**Risk Level:** High  
**Description:** Tests for path traversal vulnerabilities in file operations.  
**Test Function:** `testPathTraversal()`

**Test Scenarios:**
- Path traversal through filename manipulation
- Unsafe path construction testing
- File operation boundary validation

### 6. Symbolic Link Attack Tests
**Risk Level:** High  
**Description:** Tests for symbolic link following vulnerabilities (Unix-like systems).  
**Test Function:** `testSymbolicLinkAttack()`

**Test Scenarios:**
- Symbolic link creation and following
- Access to sensitive files through symlinks
- Symlink validation and restrictions

### 7. Resource Exhaustion Tests
**Risk Level:** Medium  
**Description:** Tests for resource exhaustion and DoS vulnerabilities.  
**Test Function:** `testResourceExhaustion()`

**Test Scenarios:**
- Large file creation and storage
- Rapid operation execution
- Memory and disk space consumption

## How to Run Tests

### Method 1: Developer Console
1. Start the Tauri application: `npm run tauri dev`
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Navigate to Console tab
4. Load the test script:
   ```javascript
   fetch('/security-reports/privilege-escalation-test-script.js')
     .then(response => response.text())
     .then(script => eval(script));
   ```
5. Run tests: `securityTests.runAll()`

### Method 2: Test Interface
1. Open the test interface HTML file in a browser
2. Use the provided buttons to run individual or all tests
3. View results in real-time

## Expected Security Measures

The application should implement the following security measures to prevent privilege escalation:

1. **Path Validation:** Strict validation of all file paths to prevent traversal
2. **Access Controls:** Proper file system access restrictions
3. **Input Sanitization:** Sanitization of all user inputs and configuration values
4. **Resource Limits:** Limits on file sizes and operation rates
5. **Privilege Separation:** Running with minimal required privileges
6. **Configuration Security:** Secure handling of configuration data

## Interpreting Results

- **üö® VULNERABLE:** Security vulnerability detected - immediate attention required
- **üõ°Ô∏è BLOCKED:** Attack successfully blocked by security measures
- **‚ùå ERROR:** Test encountered an error - may indicate implementation issues
- **üîç TESTED:** Test completed without definitive result

## Remediation Guidelines

If vulnerabilities are found:

1. **Immediate:** Disable affected functionality if possible
2. **Short-term:** Implement input validation and access controls
3. **Long-term:** Conduct comprehensive security review
4. **Ongoing:** Regular security testing and monitoring

## Compliance Considerations

These tests help ensure compliance with:
- OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)
- Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards
- Desktop application security best practices

## Conclusion

Regular privilege escalation testing is essential for maintaining the security posture of desktop applications. These tests should be run:
- Before each release
- After significant code changes
- As part of regular security assessments
- When new attack vectors are discovered
