**Impact:** macOS users will see security warnings and Gatekeeper may block the application

**Exploitability:** Medium - macOS security features may prevent application execution

**Evidence:**
- No macOS signing identity found
- No Apple Developer certificate configuration

**Recommendations:**
- Obtain Apple Developer certificate
- Configure signing identity in environment variables
- Set up notarization for macOS distribution

---

### 6. No Update Server Configuration

**Severity:** HIGH  
**Category:** Update Infrastructure  


**Description:** No update server is configured for delivering application updates.

**Impact:** No mechanism for delivering security updates to users

**Exploitability:** High - users remain vulnerable to known security issues

**Evidence:**
- No TAURI_UPDATE_SERVER environment variable
- No UPDATE_SERVER_URL configuration found
- No update delivery mechanism in place

**Recommendations:**
- Set up secure update server with HTTPS
- Configure update server URL in environment variables
- Implement authentication for update server access
- Set up CDN for global update distribution

---

### 7. No Update Server Authentication

**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Category:** Access Control  


**Description:** Update server access is not authenticated, potentially allowing unauthorized update distribution.

**Impact:** Unauthorized parties may be able to distribute malicious updates

**Exploitability:** Medium - requires access to update server infrastructure

**Evidence:**
- No UPDATE_SERVER_TOKEN found
- No UPDATE_API_KEY configuration
- Unauthenticated access to update endpoints

**Recommendations:**
- Implement API key authentication for update server
- Use JWT tokens for update request authentication
- Set up rate limiting for update requests

---

### 8. No Reproducible Build Configuration

**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Category:** Build Security  


**Description:** Build process is not configured for reproducibility, making it difficult to verify binary authenticity.

**Impact:** Difficult to verify that binaries match source code

**Exploitability:** Low - primarily affects auditability

**Evidence:**
- No reproducible build scripts
- No deterministic build configuration
- Build timestamps and environment may vary

**Recommendations:**
- Configure deterministic build settings
- Use fixed timestamps in build process
- Document build environment requirements
- Implement build verification process

---

### 9. No Update Rollback Mechanism

**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Category:** Update Safety  


**Description:** No mechanism exists to rollback failed or problematic updates.

**Impact:** Failed updates may leave application in unusable state

**Exploitability:** Low - primarily affects availability

**Evidence:**
- No rollback functionality in update process
- No backup of previous version before update
- No recovery mechanism for failed updates

**Recommendations:**
- Implement automatic backup before updates
- Add rollback functionality to update process
- Create recovery mechanism for failed updates
- Test rollback process regularly

---

### 10. No Update Package Validation

**Severity:** HIGH  
**Category:** Update Security  
**CWE:** CWE-345  

**Description:** Update packages are not validated before installation.

**Impact:** Malicious or incompatible updates may be installed

**Exploitability:** High - if update server is compromised

**Evidence:**
- No signature verification for update packages
- No version validation logic
- No compatibility checking before update

**Recommendations:**
- Implement digital signature verification for updates
- Add version compatibility checking
- Validate update package structure before installation
- Check minimum system requirements before update

---

### 11. Insecure Update Storage

**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Category:** Storage Security  


**Description:** Downloaded updates are not stored securely before installation.

**Impact:** Update files may be tampered with before installation

**Exploitability:** Medium - requires local system access

**Recommendations:**
- Store updates in secure temporary directory
- Set appropriate file permissions for update files
- Clean up temporary files after installation
- Use encrypted storage for sensitive update data

---

### 12. Unpinned Dependencies

**Severity:** LOW  
**Category:** Dependency Management  


**Description:** Dependencies are not pinned to specific versions, which may lead to unexpected updates.

**Impact:** Unexpected dependency updates may introduce vulnerabilities or break functionality

**Exploitability:** Low - requires compromised package registry

**Evidence:**
- Dependencies use version ranges instead of exact versions
- Potential for unexpected dependency updates
- Build reproducibility may be affected

**Recommendations:**
- Pin critical dependencies to exact versions
- Use package-lock.json for consistent installs
- Regularly review and update dependency versions
- Test thoroughly when updating dependencies

---

## Overall Recommendations

- Implement Tauri updater plugin with secure configuration
- Set up code signing for all target platforms
- Configure HTTPS-only update server with authentication
- Implement binary integrity verification with checksums
- Add update rollback and validation mechanisms
- Set up automated dependency security auditing
- Configure secure update storage and cleanup processes
- Implement reproducible build process for verification

## Conclusion

The update mechanism analysis reveals several critical areas that need attention to ensure secure application updates. Priority should be given to implementing code signing, secure update delivery, and binary integrity verification.

Regular security reviews of the update process should be conducted, especially when making changes to the build or deployment pipeline.
