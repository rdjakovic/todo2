# Project Changes Log

## 2025-01-05 - Fixed signOut error handling
**Time:** Current timestamp
**Summary:** Modified the signOut function in src/store/authStore.ts to properly handle session_not_found errors during logout. The function now clears the local user state and resets the todo store even when Supabase returns a session_not_found error, ensuring the UI correctly reflects the signed-out state.

**Changes made:**
- Enhanced error handling in signOut function catch block
- Added specific handling for session_not_found errors during logout
- Ensured local state is cleared even when server logout fails
- User state is now set to null and todo store is reset regardless of logout error type

## 2025-01-05 - Implemented search todos functionality
**Time:** 2025-01-05 21:00
**Summary:** Added search functionality for todos with a search field positioned in the middle of the header area. The search works across all todo fields including title and notes, and integrates with existing filtering and sorting mechanisms.

**Changes made:**
- Added `searchQuery` state and `setSearchQuery` action to todoStore
- Implemented `filterTodosBySearch` helper function to filter todos by search query
- Updated `getFilteredTodos` function to apply search filtering before sorting
- Modified TodoListView header layout to include three sections: list name (left), search field (middle), toggle (right)
- Added search input with magnifying glass icon and clear button
- Implemented responsive design for the new header layout
- Search works across all lists including "All", "Completed", and custom lists
- Search filters both todo title and notes content
- Added proper state reset for search query in the reset function

## 2025-01-05 - Added Escape key to reset search field
**Time:** 2025-01-05 21:15
**Summary:** Enhanced the search functionality by adding Escape key support to clear the search field. Users can now quickly reset the search by pressing Esc in addition to clicking the clear (X) button.

**Changes made:**
- Added `handleSearchKeyDown` function to handle keyboard events in the search input
- Added `onKeyDown` event handler to the search input field
- Implemented Escape key detection to trigger the existing `handleClearSearch` function
- Improved user experience with keyboard shortcuts for search management
