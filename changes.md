## Changes Log

### 2025-01-28 14:46:00 - Fix syntax error in initialLists.ts
- Added missing comma after `id: "completed"` property in the initialLists array
- This was causing build failures and preventing hot module reloading
- Fixed object literal syntax error that was preventing the application from compiling

### 2025-01-28 15:12:00 - Remove localStorage usage for lists/todos, keep only Supabase
**Summary:** Completely removed all localStorage operations for lists and todos data while keeping only Supabase as the single source of truth. Preserved localStorage only for user preferences like sorting.

**Key Changes:**
- **Removed localStorage operations from all CRUD functions:**
  - `fetchLists()` - now only fetches from Supabase
  - `fetchTodos()` - no localStorage fallback
  - `saveTodos()` - no localStorage backup
  - `saveLists()` - no localStorage operations
  - `addTodo()` - pure Supabase operations
  - `toggleTodo()` - no localStorage backup
  - `deleteTodo()` - no localStorage backup
  - `editTodo()` - no localStorage backup
  - `createList()` - no localStorage backup
  - `deleteList()` - no localStorage operations

- **Removed the `loadFromLocalStorage()` method entirely** as it's no longer needed

- **Updated error handling:**
  - Removed localStorage fallbacks in all error scenarios
  - All errors now show appropriate toast messages
  - Failed operations no longer fallback to "saved locally" behavior

- **Preserved localStorage for user preferences:**
  - `sortBy` setting still uses localStorage (user preference)
  - Theme settings (handled by useTheme hook) still use localStorage

- **Updated reset function:**
  - Only clears user preferences from localStorage
  - No longer manages lists/todos localStorage data

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Single Source of Truth:** All data now comes exclusively from Supabase
- ✅ **Real-time Sync:** Data is always up-to-date across devices/sessions  
- ✅ **Simplified Architecture:** No complex localStorage/Supabase synchronization logic
- ✅ **Better Error Handling:** Clear distinction between user preferences and application data
- ✅ **Reduced Complexity:** Eliminated dual storage strategies and migration logic
- ✅ **Consistent State:** No more localStorage/database inconsistencies

### 2025-01-28 15:25:00 - Fix authentication loading and duplicate "All" list issues
**Summary:** Fixed critical authentication and data loading issues that were causing inconsistent app behavior.

**Issues Resolved:**
1. **Sign-in button sometimes not loading data** - Fixed race condition in auth state management
2. **Empty data loading when no lists exist** - Fixed initial lists creation logic
3. **Duplicate "All" list in UI** - Removed "All" from database creation, kept as virtual client-side list only

**Key Changes:**
- **Fixed fetchLists() function:**
  - Removed "All" list from initialLists constant and database insertion
  - Only create database lists (Completed, Personal, Work) when no lists exist
  - "All" list remains as virtual client-side list only
  - Improved sorting logic to ensure proper list order

- **Enhanced auth state management:**
  - Added proper loading state management in auth store
  - Added error handling for failed data loading after sign-in
  - Prevented race conditions between auth state changes and data fetching

- **Improved LoginForm component:**
  - Removed manual data fetching to prevent race conditions
  - Let auth state change listener handle data loading automatically
  - Added better error handling and user feedback

- **Updated initialLists constant:**
  - Removed "All" list from the constant since it's virtual
  - Only includes lists that should be created in the database

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Reliable Sign-in:** Sign-in button now consistently loads data
- ✅ **No Duplicate Lists:** "All" list appears only once in the UI
- ✅ **Proper Initial Setup:** New users get correct initial lists created
- ✅ **Better Error Handling:** Clear feedback when data loading fails
- ✅ **Consistent State:** Eliminated race conditions in auth flow
- ✅ **Consistent State:** Eliminated race conditions in auth flow

### 2025-01-28 15:30:00 - Fix duplicate database connection success messages
**Summary:** Fixed issue where "Connection to database successful!" message was appearing twice during sign-in.

**Problem:** 
- `fetchLists()` function was showing success toast
- `fetchTodos()` function (called from `fetchLists()`) was also showing success toast
- Result: Two identical success messages during sign-in

**Solution:**
- Removed success toast from `fetchTodos()` function
- Changed `fetchLists()` success message to "Data loaded successfully!" for clarity
- Now only shows one success message per sign-in

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Clean User Experience:** Only one success message per sign-in
- ✅ **Clear Messaging:** More descriptive success message
- ✅ **Reduced Noise:** Eliminates duplicate notifications
