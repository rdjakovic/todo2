# Project Changes Log

## 2025-01-24 - Fix build error caused by visualizer plugin

## 2025-01-24 - Close sidebar automatically on mobile after list selection
**Time:** Current timestamp
**Summary:** Modified the Sidebar component to automatically close the sidebar on mobile devices (screen width < 1024px) after selecting a list. This improves mobile user experience by hiding the navigation after the user makes a selection.

**Changes made:**
- Created `handleSelectList` wrapper function in Sidebar.tsx that calls `setSelectedListId` and conditionally closes sidebar on mobile
- Added `setIsSidebarOpen` to the destructured todoStore functions
- Modified list selection handlers to use the new wrapper function
- Ensured Settings button also uses the same mobile-friendly behavior
- Mobile detection uses the existing windowWidth < 1024 breakpoint

## 2025-01-24 - Adjust horizontal spacing for mobile view
**Time:** Current timestamp
**Summary:** Modified the horizontal padding on mobile devices to provide more content space by changing the padding classes from `p-8` to `p-4 sm:p-8` in both TodoListView and SettingsView components.

**Changes made:**
- Updated `src/components/TodoListView.tsx`: Changed outer div padding class from `p-8` to `p-4 sm:p-8`
- Updated `src/components/SettingsView.tsx`: Changed outer div padding class from `p-8` to `p-4 sm:p-8`
- On mobile devices (default), padding is now 1rem (16px) instead of 2rem (32px)
- On small screens and larger (sm breakpoint and up), padding remains 2rem (32px) for optimal desktop experience
- This provides significantly more horizontal space for content on mobile devices while maintaining the comfortable spacing on larger screens

## 2025-01-24 - Reduce mobile padding to 0.5rem
**Time:** Current timestamp
**Summary:** Further reduced horizontal padding on mobile devices from 1rem to 0.5rem to maximize content space on small screens.

**Changes made:**
- Updated `src/components/TodoListView.tsx`: Changed outer div padding class from `p-4 sm:p-8` to `p-2 sm:p-8`
- Updated `src/components/SettingsView.tsx`: Changed outer div padding class from `p-4 sm:p-8` to `p-2 sm:p-8`
- On mobile devices (default), padding is now 0.5rem (8px) instead of 1rem (16px)
- On small screens and larger (sm breakpoint and up), padding remains 2rem (32px) for optimal desktop experience
- This provides maximum horizontal space for content on mobile devices while preserving the comfortable spacing on larger screens

## 2025-01-24 - Match TodoForm input height to search input
**Time:** Current timestamp
**Summary:** Updated the "Add a new todo" input height to match the search input by using consistent padding classes.

**Changes made:**
- Updated `src/components/TodoForm.tsx`: Changed input classes from `min-h-12 sm:min-h-10 px-4` to `py-2 px-4`
- Removed responsive minimum height classes in favor of consistent padding
- Both search input and todo input now use `py-2` for vertical padding, ensuring identical heights
- Updated button height to `h-10` for better visual alignment
- Maintains responsive text sizing with `text-base sm:text-sm`
- Both inputs now have the same visual height and proportions across all screen sizes
