## Changes Log

### 2025-01-28 14:46:00 - Fix syntax error in initialLists.ts
- Added missing comma after `id: "completed"` property in the initialLists array
- This was causing build failures and preventing hot module reloading
- Fixed object literal syntax error that was preventing the application from compiling

### 2025-01-28 15:12:00 - Remove localStorage usage for lists/todos, keep only Supabase
**Summary:** Completely removed all localStorage operations for lists and todos data while keeping only Supabase as the single source of truth. Preserved localStorage only for user preferences like sorting.

**Key Changes:**
- **Removed localStorage operations from all CRUD functions:**
  - `fetchLists()` - now only fetches from Supabase
  - `fetchTodos()` - no localStorage fallback
  - `saveTodos()` - no localStorage backup
  - `saveLists()` - no localStorage operations
  - `addTodo()` - pure Supabase operations
  - `toggleTodo()` - no localStorage backup
  - `deleteTodo()` - no localStorage backup
  - `editTodo()` - no localStorage backup
  - `createList()` - no localStorage backup
  - `deleteList()` - no localStorage operations

- **Removed the `loadFromLocalStorage()` method entirely** as it's no longer needed

- **Updated error handling:**
  - Removed localStorage fallbacks in all error scenarios
  - All errors now show appropriate toast messages
  - Failed operations no longer fallback to "saved locally" behavior

- **Preserved localStorage for user preferences:**
  - `sortBy` setting still uses localStorage (user preference)
  - Theme settings (handled by useTheme hook) still use localStorage

- **Updated reset function:**
  - Only clears user preferences from localStorage
  - No longer manages lists/todos localStorage data

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Single Source of Truth:** All data now comes exclusively from Supabase

### 2025-01-28 15:25:00 - Fix authentication loading and duplicate "All" list issues
**Summary:** Fixed critical authentication and data loading issues that were causing inconsistent app behavior.

**Issues Resolved:**
1. **Sign-in button sometimes not loading data** - Fixed race condition in auth state management
2. **Empty data loading when no lists exist** - Fixed initial lists creation logic
3. **Duplicate "All" list in UI** - Removed "All" from database creation, kept as virtual client-side list only

**Key Changes:**
- **Fixed fetchLists() function:**
  - Removed "All" list from initialLists constant and database insertion
  - Only create database lists (Completed, Personal, Work) when no lists exist
  - "All" list remains as virtual client-side list only
  - Improved sorting logic to ensure proper list order

- **Enhanced auth state management:**
  - Added proper loading state management in auth store
  - Added error handling for failed data loading after sign-in
  - Prevented race conditions between auth state changes and data fetching

- **Improved LoginForm component:**
  - Removed manual data fetching to prevent race conditions
  - Let auth state change listener handle data loading automatically
  - Added better error handling and user feedback

- **Updated initialLists constant:**
  - Removed "All" list from the constant since it's virtual

**Summary:** Fixed issue where "Connection to database successful!" message was appearing twice during sign-in.

**Problem:** 
- `fetchLists()` function was showing success toast
- `fetchTodos()` function (called from `fetchLists()`) was also showing success toast
- Result: Two identical success messages during sign-in

**Solution:**
- Removed success toast from `fetchTodos()` function
- Changed `fetchLists()` success message to "Data loaded successfully!" for clarity
- Now only shows one success message per sign-in

**Benefits:**

- Auth state change listener was triggering multiple SIGNED_IN events
- Each event was calling `fetchLists()` independently
- Result: Multiple database calls and duplicate "Data loaded successfully!" messages

**Solution:**
- Added `isLoadingData` flag to prevent concurrent data loading
- Only allow one data loading operation at a time during sign-in
- Reset flag on sign-out and after loading completes
- Added proper cleanup in finally block

**Benefits:**

### 2025-01-28 16:45:00 - Fix sign out data persistence issue
**Summary:** Fixed critical security issue where user data persisted in IndexedDB after sign out, allowing data to be visible after browser refresh even when not authenticated.

**Problem:** 
- When signing out, IndexedDB data was not being cleared
- On browser refresh, `fetchLists()` would load data from IndexedDB regardless of authentication state
- This allowed previous user's data to be visible even when not logged in
- Created a security vulnerability where data could persist across user sessions

**Solution:**
- **Enhanced sign out process:**
  - Clear IndexedDB data BEFORE calling `supabase.auth.signOut()`
  - Ensure data is cleared even if sign out fails due to session errors
  - Added IndexedDB clearing to all error handling paths in sign out

- **Improved data loading security:**
  - Added authentication check at the start of `fetchLists()` function
  - Verify that offline data belongs to the current authenticated user
  - Clear IndexedDB if data belongs to a different user
  - Filter todos to only include those belonging to current user's lists

- **Better user data isolation:**
  - Prevent cross-user data contamination in offline storage
  - Ensure each user only sees their own data
  - Clear all local data on authentication state changes

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Data Security:** No data persists after sign out
- ✅ **User Privacy:** Each user only sees their own data
- ✅ **Clean Sessions:** Fresh start for each authentication session
- ✅ **No Data Leakage:** Prevents previous user's data from being visible
- ✅ **Proper Authentication Flow:** Data only loads when properly authenticated

### 2025-01-28 17:00:00 - Fix sign-in button not loading data issue
**Summary:** Fixed issue where clicking "Sign In" button sometimes didn't load data until browser refresh, implementing multiple fallback mechanisms to ensure reliable data loading.

**Problem:** 
- Sign-in button would authenticate successfully but data wouldn't load immediately
- Users had to refresh the browser to see their data
- Auth state change listener wasn't always triggering reliably
- Race condition between authentication and data loading

**Solution:**
- **Enhanced LoginForm component:**
  - Added backup data loading mechanism with 500ms delay after successful sign-in
  - Uses `forceDataLoad()` as fallback if auth state change doesn't trigger
  - Provides additional safety net for data loading

- **Improved error handling in forceDataLoad:**
  - Better logging to track when data loading is skipped vs. attempted
  - Re-throw errors to allow callers to handle failures appropriately
  - More detailed console logging for debugging

- **Enhanced auth state change listener:**
  - Added try-catch blocks around data loading calls
  - Better error logging for failed data loads
  - Prevents auth state change failures from breaking the flow

- **Added backup mechanism in App.tsx:**
  - Automatically detects when user exists but no data is loaded
  - Triggers backup data loading as additional safety net
  - Runs after initial auth check to catch missed data loads

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Reliable Sign-in:** Multiple fallback mechanisms ensure data always loads
- ✅ **Better User Experience:** No need to refresh browser after sign-in
- ✅ **Robust Error Handling:** Graceful handling of auth and data loading failures
