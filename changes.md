# Project Changes Log

## 2025-01-05 - Fixed signOut error handling
**Time:** Current timestamp
**Summary:** Modified the signOut function in src/store/authStore.ts to properly handle session_not_found errors during logout. The function now clears the local user state and resets the todo store even when Supabase returns a session_not_found error, ensuring the UI correctly reflects the signed-out state.

**Changes made:**
- Enhanced error handling in signOut function catch block
- Added specific handling for session_not_found errors during logout
- Ensured local state is cleared even when server logout fails
- User state is now set to null and todo store is reset regardless of logout error type

## 2025-01-27 - TypeScript Error Fix
**Date:** January 27, 2025  
**Time:** Current timestamp  
**Summary:** Fixed TypeScript error in App.tsx by removing invalid `onEdit` prop from TodoItem component in DragOverlay. The TodoItem component uses `onOpenEditDialog` for edit functionality, so the `onEdit` prop was not needed and was causing compilation errors.

## 2025-01-27 - Comprehensive Code Cleanup
**Date:** January 27, 2025
**Time:** Current timestamp
**Summary:** Performed comprehensive cleanup of unused code, imports, variables, and functions throughout the application to improve maintainability and reduce bundle size.

**Changes made:**

### Tauri Backend Cleanup (src-tauri/src/lib.rs):
- Removed all commented-out unused code including imports, constants, and functions
- Cleaned up the invoke_handler to only include necessary functionality
- Removed unused `save_todos`, `save_lists`, `load_todos`, `load_lists` functions that were marked as unused

### Component Interface Cleanup:
- **TodoItem.tsx**: Removed unused `onEdit` prop from TodoItemProps interface and component implementation
- **TodoItem.tsx**: Fixed `getPriorityColors` helper function by removing unused `priority` parameter
- **LoginForm.tsx**: Removed unused `onSuccess` prop from LoginFormProps interface and component
- **TodoItem.test.tsx**: Updated test to use string IDs instead of numbers and removed unused mock functions

### App.tsx Optimizations:
- Removed unused `fetchLists` from useTodoStore destructuring 
- Removed unnecessary `onSuccess` prop from LoginForm component
- Removed invalid `onEdit` prop from TodoItem component in DragOverlay
- Improved data fetching logic to avoid dependency issues

### Utility Functions Cleanup (src/utils/helper.ts):
- Removed unused `processLoadedLists` function (no longer needed with normalized data structure)
- Removed unused `getListNameById` function (not used anywhere in codebase)
- Removed unused `getListByName` function (not used anywhere in codebase)
- Kept only actively used utility functions: `getListById`, `isValidNativeDate`, `formatNativeDate`

### Benefits Achieved:
- ðŸ§¹ **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed all dead code and unused imports
- ðŸ“¦ **Smaller Bundle Size**: Eliminated unused functions and imports from build
- ðŸ”§ **Better Maintainability**: Reduced cognitive load by removing confusing unused code
- âœ… **Type Safety**: Fixed all TypeScript errors related to incorrect prop types
- ðŸš€ **Performance**: Reduced memory usage by eliminating unused function definitions

**Files Modified:**
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`: Removed all commented unused code
- `src/App.tsx`: Removed unused imports and props
- `src/components/TodoItem.tsx`: Cleaned up interface and helper functions
- `src/components/TodoItem.test.tsx`: Fixed test data types and removed unused mocks
- `src/components/LoginForm.tsx`: Removed unused props
- `src/utils/helper.ts`: Removed unused utility functions

The application now has a much cleaner codebase with no unused code, better type safety, and improved maintainability.
