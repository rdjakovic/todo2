# Changes Log

## 2025-01-01 10:58:00 - Fixed JSX Syntax Error
- Fixed unterminated JSX contents error in ListEditDialog.tsx
- Added missing closing </div> tag to properly close the dialog container structure
- Resolved Vite compilation error that was preventing the application from running

## 2025-01-01 11:15:00 - Implemented List Sorting Logic
- Modified fetchLists function in todoStore.ts to ensure proper list ordering
- Home list is always displayed first in the sidebar
- Completed list is always displayed second in the sidebar  
- All other custom lists are sorted by their creation date (oldest first)
- Updated both the state management and localStorage to maintain consistent ordering

## 2025-01-01 11:30:00 - Fixed Completed List Functionality
- Fixed "Completed" list to show all completed todos from all lists, not just todos assigned to the "Completed" list
- Updated getFilteredTodos function to handle "Completed" list specially - it now returns all completed todos regardless of their original list
- Updated getTodoCountByList function to properly count all completed todos for the "Completed" list
- Disabled the show/hide completed toggle for the "Completed" list since it should always show all completed tasks
- Added visual feedback (disabled state, opacity, cursor) for the toggle button when on "Completed" list
- Updated the toggle label text to indicate "All Completed Tasks" when viewing the "Completed" list

## 2025-01-01 12:00:00 - Enhanced Completed List Drag and Drop Behavior
- Implemented special drag and drop behavior for the "Completed" list
- When dragging a todo from any list TO the "Completed" list: automatically marks the todo as completed and sets dateOfCompletion
- When dragging a todo FROM the "Completed" list TO another list: automatically marks the todo as not completed and clears dateOfCompletion
- This provides intuitive behavior where the "Completed" list acts as a completion state manager during drag operations
- Enhanced user experience by making the completion status automatically sync with the list placement

## 2025-01-01 12:30:00 - Renamed "Home" to "All" and Implemented Special Behavior
- Renamed the "Home" list to "All" throughout the application
- Updated the "All" list to be a client-side only placeholder that shows all todos from all lists
- Modified fetchLists to exclude the "All" list from database operations while creating it locally
- Updated getFilteredTodos to show all todos when "All" list is selected (respecting showCompleted setting)
- Updated getTodoCountByList to count all incomplete todos for the "All" list
- Implemented drag and drop restrictions:
  - Prevented dropping any todo onto the "All" list
  - When dragging from "All" list, only allow dropping to "Completed" list
- Added protection against editing or deleting the "All" list
- Updated localStorage handling to exclude the "All" list from persistence
- Updated tests to reflect the "All" list naming
- The "All" list now serves as a unified view of all todos across all lists while maintaining proper data separation
