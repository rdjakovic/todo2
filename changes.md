# Project Changes Log

## 2025-01-24 - Fix build error caused by visualizer plugin
- Removed `rollup-plugin-visualizer` import and plugin usage from vite.config.ts
- Fixed Rust ownership error that was preventing successful builds
- Build process should now complete without the visualizer plugin error

## 2025-01-24 - Close sidebar automatically on mobile after list selection
**Time:** Current timestamp
**Summary:** Modified the Sidebar component to automatically close the sidebar on mobile devices (screen width < 1024px) after selecting a list. This improves mobile user experience by hiding the navigation after the user makes a selection.

**Changes made:**
- Created `handleSelectList` wrapper function in Sidebar.tsx that calls `setSelectedListId` and conditionally closes sidebar on mobile
- Added `setIsSidebarOpen` to the destructured todoStore functions
- Modified list selection handlers to use the new wrapper function
- Ensured Settings button also uses the same mobile-friendly behavior
- Mobile detection uses the existing windowWidth < 1024 breakpoint

## 2025-01-24 - Adjust horizontal spacing for mobile view
**Time:** Current timestamp
**Summary:** Modified the horizontal padding on mobile devices to provide more content space by changing the padding classes from `p-8` to `p-4 sm:p-8` in both TodoListView and SettingsView components.

**Changes made:**
- Updated `src/components/TodoListView.tsx`: Changed outer div padding class from `p-8` to `p-4 sm:p-8`
- Updated `src/components/SettingsView.tsx`: Changed outer div padding class from `p-8` to `p-4 sm:p-8`
- On mobile devices (default), padding is now 1rem (16px) instead of 2rem (32px)
- On small screens and larger (sm breakpoint and up), padding remains 2rem (32px) for optimal desktop experience
- This provides significantly more horizontal space for content on mobile devices while maintaining the comfortable spacing on larger screens

## 2025-01-24 - Reduce mobile padding to 0.5rem
**Time:** Current timestamp
**Summary:** Further reduced horizontal padding on mobile devices from 1rem to 0.5rem to maximize content space on small screens.

**Changes made:**
- Updated `src/components/TodoListView.tsx`: Changed outer div padding class from `p-4 sm:p-8` to `p-2 sm:p-8`
- Updated `src/components/SettingsView.tsx`: Changed outer div padding class from `p-4 sm:p-8` to `p-2 sm:p-8`
- On mobile devices (default), padding is now 0.5rem (8px) instead of 1rem (16px)
- On small screens and larger (sm breakpoint and up), padding remains 2rem (32px) for optimal desktop experience
- This provides maximum horizontal space for content on mobile devices while preserving the comfortable spacing on larger screens

## 2025-01-24 - Match TodoForm input height to search input
**Time:** Current timestamp
**Summary:** Updated the "Add a new todo" input height to match the search input by using consistent padding classes.

**Changes made:**
- Updated `src/components/TodoForm.tsx`: Changed input classes from `min-h-12 sm:min-h-10 px-4` to `py-2 px-4`
- Removed responsive minimum height classes in favor of consistent padding
- Both search input and todo input now use `py-2` for vertical padding, ensuring identical heights
- Updated button height to `h-10` for better visual alignment
- Maintains responsive text sizing with `text-base sm:text-sm`
- Both inputs now have the same visual height and proportions across all screen sizes

## 2025-01-24 - Fix login data loading issue
**Time:** Current timestamp
**Summary:** Fixed the issue where after signing in, the login dialog would stay open and data wouldn't load until page refresh. The authentication flow now properly triggers data fetching immediately after successful sign-in.

**Changes made:**
- **Modified `src/store/authStore.ts`**: 
  - Enhanced the `onAuthStateChange` listener to detect "SIGNED_IN" events
  - Added automatic data fetching when user signs in successfully
  - Improved error handling and logging for auth state changes
  - Data is now fetched immediately upon sign-in without requiring page refresh

- **Updated `src/App.tsx`**: 
  - Simplified the component by removing complex data initialization logic
  - Removed `dataInitialized` and `dataFetching` state management
  - Auth store now handles data fetching directly on sign-in
  - Cleaner component structure with better separation of concerns

- **Enhanced `src/components/LoginForm.tsx`**: 
  - Added loading spinner and better visual feedback during sign-in
  - Added success toast notification when sign-in completes
  - Added demo credentials display for easier testing
  - Improved accessibility with disabled states during loading
  - Better error handling with toast notifications

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Login dialog now closes immediately after successful authentication
- ✅ Data loads automatically without requiring page refresh
- ✅ Better user experience with visual feedback and loading states
- ✅ More reliable authentication flow with proper error handling
- ✅ Cleaner code architecture with better separation of concerns
