# Project Changes Log

## 2025-01-05 - Fixed signOut error handling
**Time:** Current timestamp
**Summary:** Modified the signOut function in src/store/authStore.ts to properly handle session_not_found errors during logout. The function now clears the local user state and resets the todo store even when Supabase returns a session_not_found error, ensuring the UI correctly reflects the signed-out state.

**Changes made:**
- Enhanced error handling in signOut function catch block
- Added specific handling for session_not_found errors during logout
- Ensured local state is cleared even when server logout fails
- User state is now set to null and todo store is reset regardless of logout error type

## 2025-01-05 - Implemented search todos functionality
**Time:** 2025-01-05 21:00
**Summary:** Added search functionality for todos with a search field positioned in the middle of the header area. The search works across all todo fields including title and notes, and integrates with existing filtering and sorting mechanisms.

**Changes made:**
- Added `searchQuery` state and `setSearchQuery` action to todoStore
- Implemented `filterTodosBySearch` helper function to filter todos by search query
- Updated `getFilteredTodos` function to apply search filtering before sorting
- Modified TodoListView header layout to include three sections: list name (left), search field (middle), toggle (right)
- Added search input with magnifying glass icon and clear button
- Implemented responsive design for the new header layout
- Search works across all lists including "All", "Completed", and custom lists
- Search filters both todo title and notes content
- Added proper state reset for search query in the reset function

## 2025-01-05 - Added Escape key to reset search field
**Time:** 2025-01-05 21:15
**Summary:** Enhanced the search functionality by adding Escape key support to clear the search field. Users can now quickly reset the search by pressing Esc in addition to clicking the clear (X) button.

**Changes made:**
- Added `handleSearchKeyDown` function to handle keyboard events in the search input
- Added `onKeyDown` event handler to the search input field
- Implemented Escape key detection to trigger the existing `handleClearSearch` function
- Improved user experience with keyboard shortcuts for search management

## 2025-01-05 - Fixed search field width in mobile view
**Time:** 2025-01-05 21:30
**Summary:** Adjusted the search field width to match the todo items container width in mobile view. Previously, the search field was constrained by max-width on mobile devices, making it narrower than the todo items.

**Changes made:**
- Changed search field container from `flex-1 max-w-md mx-auto lg:mx-0` to `w-full lg:flex-1 lg:max-w-md lg:mx-0`
- On mobile devices: search field now uses full width (`w-full`)
- On large screens and up: search field maintains previous styling with `max-w-md` constraint
- Search field now perfectly aligns with todo items width across all screen sizes
- Improved visual consistency between search field and todo items layout

## 2025-01-05 - Moved due date to next line in mobile view
**Time:** 2025-01-05 21:45
**Summary:** Improved the mobile layout of todo items by moving the due date badge to its own line on mobile devices while keeping it inline with other elements on larger screens. This prevents overcrowding and improves readability on smaller screens.

**Changes made:**
- Modified TodoItem.tsx layout structure to separate due date display for mobile vs desktop
- On mobile: due date now appears on its own line below the date created and priority badges
- On desktop (sm and up): due date remains inline with other elements as before
- Used responsive utility classes: `hidden sm:inline-block` for desktop inline display and `sm:hidden` for mobile separate line
- Maintained existing styling and functionality while improving mobile user experience
- Better visual hierarchy and reduced horizontal crowding on mobile devices

## 2025-01-05 - Implemented PWA functionality
**Time:** 2025-01-05 22:00
**Summary:** Added Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities to enable mobile installation and offline functionality. Users can now install the app on their devices and use it offline with cached content.

**Changes made:**
- Created `public/manifest.json` with comprehensive PWA configuration including app metadata, icons, shortcuts, and screenshots
- Implemented `public/sw.js` service worker for offline caching, background sync, and push notification support
- Updated `index.html` with PWA meta tags, Apple touch icons, Microsoft tiles, and service worker registration
- Enhanced `vite.config.ts` to properly handle PWA assets during build process
- Created `PWAInstallPrompt.tsx` component to provide native install prompts with iOS-specific instructions
- Integrated PWA install prompt into main `App.tsx` component
- Added support for offline caching of critical app resources
- Implemented background sync capability for future data synchronization
- Added push notification infrastructure for future enhancements
- Configured proper PWA shortcuts for quick actions
- Enhanced app with standalone display mode and proper theme colors
- Maintained full backward compatibility - app still works as normal web application

## 2025-01-05 - Updated browser icon to use PWA icon
**Time:** 2025-01-05 22:15
**Summary:** Changed the web browser favicon from the default Vite logo to use the custom PWA icon for better branding consistency. The browser tab now displays the Todo App icon instead of the generic Vite logo.

**Changes made:**
- Updated `index.html` favicon link from `/vite.svg` to `/icons/pwa-192x192.png`
- Changed icon type from `image/svg+xml` to `image/png` to match the new PNG format
- Maintained all existing PWA icon configurations (Apple touch icons, Microsoft tiles)
- Improved visual consistency across all platform implementations
- Browser tabs now show the custom Todo App icon instead of the Vite logo
