## Changes Log

### 2025-01-28 14:46:00 - Fix syntax error in initialLists.ts
- Added missing comma after `id: "completed"` property in the initialLists array
- This was causing build failures and preventing hot module reloading
- Fixed object literal syntax error that was preventing the application from compiling

### 2025-01-28 15:12:00 - Remove localStorage usage for lists/todos, keep only Supabase
**Summary:** Completely removed all localStorage operations for lists and todos data while keeping only Supabase as the single source of truth. Preserved localStorage only for user preferences like sorting.

**Key Changes:**
- **Removed localStorage operations from all CRUD functions:**
  - `fetchLists()` - now only fetches from Supabase
  - `fetchTodos()` - no localStorage fallback
  - `saveTodos()` - no localStorage backup
  - `saveLists()` - no localStorage operations
  - `addTodo()` - pure Supabase operations
  - `toggleTodo()` - no localStorage backup
  - `deleteTodo()` - no localStorage backup
  - `editTodo()` - no localStorage backup
  - `createList()` - no localStorage backup
  - `deleteList()` - no localStorage operations

- **Removed the `loadFromLocalStorage()` method entirely** as it's no longer needed

- **Updated error handling:**
  - Removed localStorage fallbacks in all error scenarios
  - All errors now show appropriate toast messages
  - Failed operations no longer fallback to "saved locally" behavior

- **Preserved localStorage for user preferences:**
  - `sortBy` setting still uses localStorage (user preference)
  - Theme settings (handled by useTheme hook) still use localStorage

- **Updated reset function:**
  - Only clears user preferences from localStorage
  - No longer manages lists/todos localStorage data

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Single Source of Truth:** All data now comes exclusively from Supabase
- ✅ **Real-time Sync:** Data is always up-to-date across devices/sessions  
- ✅ **Simplified Architecture:** No complex localStorage/Supabase synchronization logic
- ✅ **Better Error Handling:** Clear distinction between user preferences and application data
- ✅ **Reduced Complexity:** Eliminated dual storage strategies and migration logic
- ✅ **Consistent State:** No more localStorage/database inconsistencies
