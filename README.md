### **Versions errors - Steps to Fix**

1. **Verify the Available Versions**
   Check the latest version of `tauri` available on crates.io by visiting its [crates.io page](https://crates.io/crates/tauri). At the time of this response, the latest version appears to be `2.2.3`. You cannot specify a version (`^2.2.5`) that does not exist.

2. **Update `Cargo.toml`**
   Modify your `Cargo.toml` file to match an existing version. For example:

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   tauri = "2.2.3"
   ```

   The `^2.2.3` constraint is also valid and will automatically allow updates to compatible patch versions (`2.2.x`).

3. **Update the Cargo Index**
   Sometimes the local cargo registry index might be outdated. Run the following command to update it:

   ```bash
   cargo update
   ```

   This will refresh the list of available crate versions.

4. **Check for Tauri Pre-releases**
   If you intended to use a pre-release or a specific branch, make sure to specify it explicitly in your `Cargo.toml`. For example:

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   tauri = { git = "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri", branch = "dev" }
   ```

   This pulls the latest code from the Tauri repository's `dev` branch.

5. **Clear the Cargo Cache (Optional)**
   If the issue persists, clear the Cargo cache and rebuild:

   ```bash
   cargo clean
   cargo build
   ```

6. **Check Dependency Conflicts**
   Ensure that no other dependencies are requiring an incompatible version of `tauri`. Run:

   ```bash
   cargo tree | grep tauri
   ```

   This will show how `tauri` is being resolved among dependencies.

### **Conclusion**

After making these adjustments, try building the project again with:

```bash
cargo build
```
