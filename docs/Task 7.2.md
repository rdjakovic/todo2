ask 7.2 Completion Summary
I have successfully completed task 7.2 "Assess build and deployment security" from the security analysis specification. Here's what was accomplished:

‚úÖ Task Requirements Completed:
Review build configuration in vite.config.ts and package.json ‚úÖ

Analyzed Vite configuration for security settings
Reviewed package.json for security scripts and dependencies
Identified compression settings and development server configuration
Analyze deployment security practices and configurations ‚úÖ

Examined Tauri configuration for desktop deployment security
Analyzed service worker security implementation
Reviewed environment configuration and secrets management
Test for security misconfigurations in build process ‚úÖ

Identified TypeScript compilation errors preventing secure builds
Found hardcoded credentials in service worker
Detected disabled Content Security Policy in Tauri configuration
Evaluate CORS and security header configurations ‚úÖ

Analyzed missing security headers in HTML and build configuration
Identified lack of CORS configuration
Found missing Content Security Policy implementation
üîç Key Security Findings:
Critical Issues (4):

Content Security Policy disabled in Tauri configuration
Hardcoded API credentials in service worker
TypeScript compilation errors preventing builds
Build process failures
High Priority Issues (3):

Missing Content Security Policy in build process
No CSP meta tag in HTML
.env file present in repository
Medium Priority Issues (6):

Missing security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy)
No CI/CD pipeline detected
Missing API allowlist in Tauri configuration
üìä Deliverables Created:
Comprehensive Security Analysis Script (src/security/scripts/run-build-deployment-analysis.ts)

Automated build and deployment security analyzer
Configurable reporting with JSON and Markdown output
Integration with npm scripts for easy execution
Detailed Security Report (security-reports/build-deployment-security-analysis-detailed.md)

Executive summary with risk assessment
Categorized security findings with recommendations
Compliance status assessment (OWASP, NIST, SOC 2)
Package.json Integration

Added security scripts for build analysis
npm run security:build:verbose for detailed analysis
npm run security:build:report for report generation
üéØ Requirements Verification:
Requirement 6.2: Environment and configuration security assessed ‚úÖ
Requirement 6.4: CORS and security header configurations evaluated ‚úÖ
The analysis identified critical security issues that must be addressed before production deployment, particularly the hardcoded credentials and disabled Content Security Policy. The automated analysis tool provides ongoing capability to monitor build and deployment security as the application evolves.
