Description: Implemented a new feature to allow users to set a custom storage path for their todos and lists. This involved adding a new settings option in the UI, updating the Tauri backend to handle the custom path, and ensuring that data is correctly loaded from and saved to the specified location.

Description: Added `notes`, `priority`, `dueDate`, and `dateOfCompletion` fields to the `Todo` interface and updated the application to support these new fields. This included modifying the `addTodo`, `toggleTodo`, and `editTodo` functions in `App.tsx`, as well as updating the `EditTodoDialog.tsx` component to include input fields for these new properties.

Description: Set up the BrowserTools MCP server. Performed an initial audit of the application, identifying areas for SEO and performance improvement. Implemented Phase 1 SEO fixes (added meta description and robots.txt), raising SEO score to 100. Implemented Phase 2 performance optimizations (configured asset compression, bundle visualization, and lazy-loaded EditTodoDialog and TodoItem components), resulting in a reduced main JavaScript bundle size.

Date: 2025-05-11
Description: Refactored date fields (`dateCreated`, `dueDate`, `dateOfCompletion`) in the `Todo` interface from `string` to `Date` type for improved type safety and date manipulation.
Summary:
Changed the type of `dateCreated`, `dueDate`, and `dateOfCompletion` from `string` to `Date` in `src/types/todo.ts`.
Updated `src/App.tsx` to handle serialization (to ISO string for storage) and deserialization (from string to `Date` object on load) for these date fields. Ensured new todos and date updates use `Date` objects.
Modified `src/components/TodoItem.tsx` to correctly format `Date` objects for display using `date-fns`.
Adjusted `src/components/EditTodoDialog.tsx` to handle `Date` objects for `dueDate`, including formatting `Date` to string for the input field and parsing the input string back to a `Date` object on save.
Updated `src/components/TodoItem.test.tsx` to use `Date` objects in mock data.
All related TypeScript errors were resolved.

Date: 2025-05-11
Description: Added display of `dateOfCompletion` in the TodoItem component and made it responsive.
Summary:
Modified `src/components/TodoItem.tsx` to display the `dateOfCompletion` next to the `dateCreated`. The `dateOfCompletion` is only shown if the todo is marked as completed and the `dateOfCompletion` is set. The dates are displayed using flexbox with `justify-between` to position them on opposite sides on larger screens (sm and up), and stack vertically (`flex-col`) on smaller screens.

Description: Fixed "Invalid time value" error in Edge browser using native JavaScript date handling.
Summary:
Removed `date-fns` dependency from `src/components/TodoItem.tsx`.
Implemented helper functions `isValidNativeDate` (using `d instanceof Date && !isNaN(d.getTime())`) and `formatNativeDate` (to format dates as "MMM d, yyyy - HH:mm") within `src/components/TodoItem.tsx`.
Updated the date display logic for `todo.dateCreated` and `todo.dateOfCompletion` to use these native helper functions. This resolves the `RangeError: Invalid time value` in Edge without external libraries.

---

Date: 2025-05-11
Description: Refactored helper functions into a separate file.
Summary: Created `src/utils/helper.ts` and moved `isValidNativeDate` and `formatNativeDate` functions from `src/components/TodoItem.tsx` to this new file. Updated `src/components/TodoItem.tsx` to import these functions from `src/utils/helper.ts`.

---

Date: 2025-05-11
Description: Refactored App.tsx to improve modularity and readability.
Summary:
Extracted UI sections from `App.tsx` into new, more focused components:

- `src/components/LoadingIndicator.tsx`: Displays a loading spinner.
- `src/components/SettingsView.tsx`: Renders the settings page content.
- `src/components/TodoForm.tsx`: Handles the form for adding new todos.
- `src/components/TodoListItems.tsx`: Renders the sortable list of todo items.
- `src/components/TodoListView.tsx`: Manages the main todo list view, incorporating `TodoForm` and `TodoListItems`.
  Moved several utility/helper functions from `App.tsx` to `src/utils/helper.ts`:
- `processLoadedLists`: Converts raw list data from storage into the `TodoList[]` format.
- `serializeListsForSave`: Prepares `TodoList[]` for saving by converting `Date` objects to ISO strings.
- `getFilteredTodos`: Computes the `filteredTodos` array based on the current `selectedList` and `hideCompleted` status.
- `calculateTodoCountByList`: Computes the `todoCountByList` object.
  Updated `App.tsx` to import and use these new components and helper functions, significantly reducing its size and complexity.

Description: Fixed Framer Motion warning in TodoListItems component.
Summary:
Modified `src/components/TodoListItems.tsx` to correctly use `React.forwardRef`. This resolves the console warning "Warning: Function components cannot be given refs. Attempts to access this ref will fail. Did you mean to use React.forwardRef()?" that occurred when using `AnimatePresence` with `mode="popLayout"`. The component now properly forwards refs to the underlying `motion.div` element.

Date: 2025-05-11
Description: Fixed drag and drop error related to lazy loading.
Task Completed:
Changed the import of `TodoItem` in `src/App.tsx` from a lazy-loaded component (`React.lazy`) to a direct import. This resolves the "A component suspended while responding to synchronous input" error that occurred during drag-and-drop operations when `DragOverlay` attempted to render the lazy-loaded `TodoItem`.

---

Date: 2025-05-11
Description: Removed unused `isEditing` property from the Todo interface.
Task Completed:
Analyzed the codebase to determine where the `isEditing?: boolean;` property, defined in the `Todo` interface in `src/types/todo.ts`, is used. The analysis found no usages of this property. Consequently, the `isEditing` property was removed from the `Todo` interface in `src/types/todo.ts`.

---

Date: 2025-05-11
Description: Removed unused `editText` property from the Todo interface.
Task Completed:
Analyzed the codebase to determine where the `editText?: string;` property, defined in the `Todo` interface in `src/types/todo.ts`, is used. The analysis found no usages of this property. Consequently, the `editText` property was removed from the `Todo` interface in `src/types/todo.ts`.

---

Date: 2025-05-11
Description: Renamed 'text' field to 'title' in Todo interface and updated all references.
Task Completed:
Renamed the `text` field to `title` in the `Todo` interface in `src/types/todo.ts`.
Updated all references to this field in the following files:

- `src/App.tsx`: Changed `text` to `title` in `addTodo`, `editTodo`, and `handleSaveEditDialog`.
- `src/components/TodoItem.tsx`: Changed `todo.text` to `todo.title` for displaying the todo.
- `src/components/EditTodoDialog.tsx`: Changed `newText` to `newTitle` in `onSave` prop and updated `todoToEdit.text` to `todoToEdit.title` in `useEffect`.
- `src/components/TodoItem.test.tsx`: Changed `text` to `title` in `mockTodo`.
  All TypeScript errors related to this change were resolved.

Description: Extracted ListItem component from Sidebar.
Task Completed:
Extracted the `ListItem` component and the `getIconForList` helper function from `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` into a new file `src/components/ListItem.tsx`. Updated `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` to remove the extracted code and import the `ListItem` component from the new file. This improves modularity by separating the list item rendering logic from the main sidebar component.

Summary of State Management Refactoring
I have successfully analyzed and refactored the application to use the global useTodoStore instead of local state and props throughout the application. Here's what was accomplished:

ðŸ”§ Store Enhancements
Extended todoStore.ts with new state and actions:

Form state: newTodo, setNewTodo
Edit dialog state: isEditDialogOpen, todoToEditDialog, setIsEditDialogOpen, setTodoToEditDialog
UI state: isSidebarOpen, sidebarWidth, windowWidth with corresponding setters
Drag & drop state: activeDraggedTodo, setActiveDraggedTodo
Helper functions: getCurrentList(), getFilteredTodos(), getTodoCountByList(), openEditDialog(), closeEditDialog(), addTodoFromForm()
List management: createList(), deleteList(), editList(), toggleSidebar()
ðŸ“± Component Refactoring

1. App.tsx

âœ… Removed local state: newTodo, isEditDialogOpen, todoToEditDialog, isSidebarOpen, sidebarWidth, windowWidth, activeDraggedTodo
âœ… Eliminated prop drilling by using store directly
âœ… Simplified component by removing unnecessary functions (addTodo, handleOpenEditDialog, handleCloseEditDialog)
âœ… Updated to use store's closeEditDialog() instead of local function 2. TodoListView.tsx

âœ… Removed all props - now uses store directly
âœ… Uses getFilteredTodos() from store instead of receiving filteredTodos prop
âœ… Uses openEditDialog() from store instead of prop function
âœ… Simplified component interface completely 3. TodoForm.tsx

âœ… Removed all props (newTodo, setNewTodo, addTodo)
âœ… Now uses newTodo, setNewTodo, and addTodoFromForm directly from store
âœ… Completely self-contained component 4. Sidebar.tsx

âœ… Completely refactored to use store instead of 12+ props
âœ… Now uses store functions: createList(), deleteList(), editList(), toggleSidebar()
âœ… Gets todoCountByList from store's getTodoCountByList()
âœ… Removed local windowWidth state in favor of store's windowWidth
âœ… Self-contained component with no external dependencies 5. EditTodoDialog.tsx

âœ… Fixed type mismatch: changed id parameter from number to string
âœ… Updated onSave to return Promise<void> for consistency
ðŸŽ¯ Benefits Achieved
Eliminated Prop Drilling: No more passing state and functions through multiple component layers
Centralized State: All application state is now managed in one place
Simplified Components: Components are more focused and self-contained
Better Type Safety: Consistent typing throughout the application
Improved Maintainability: Changes to state logic only need to be made in the store
Enhanced Developer Experience: Easier to debug and understand state flow
ðŸ§¹ Code Cleanup
âœ… Removed unused imports (TodoList type, unused store functions)
âœ… Cleaned up unused variables and parameters
âœ… Fixed type inconsistencies
âœ… Maintained all existing functionality while simplifying the codebase
ðŸš€ Application Status
The application is now running successfully at http://localhost:1420/ with:

âœ… All original functionality preserved
âœ… Improved state management architecture
âœ… No breaking changes to user experience
âœ… Better code organization and maintainability
The refactoring is complete and the application now follows modern React patterns with centralized state management using Zustand, eliminating the need for prop drilling and making the codebase much more maintainable and scalable.
