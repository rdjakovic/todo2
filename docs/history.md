Description: Set up the BrowserTools MCP server. Performed an initial audit of the application, identifying areas for SEO and performance improvement. Implemented Phase 1 SEO fixes (added meta description and robots.txt), raising SEO score to 100.

Description: Refactored date fields (`dateCreated`, `dueDate`, `dateOfCompletion`) in the `Todo` interface from `string` to `Date` type for improved type safety and date manipulation.
Summary:
Changed the type of `dateCreated`, `dueDate`, and `dateOfCompletion` from `string` to `Date` in `src/types/todo.ts`.
Updated `src/App.tsx` to handle serialization (to ISO string for storage) and deserialization (from string to `Date` object on load) for these date fields. Ensured new todos and date updates use `Date` objects.
Modified `src/components/TodoItem.tsx` to correctly format `Date` objects for display using `date-fns`.
Adjusted `src/components/EditTodoDialog.tsx` to handle `Date` objects for `dueDate`, including formatting `Date` to string for the input field and parsing the input string back to a `Date` object on save.
Updated `src/components/TodoItem.test.tsx` to use `Date` objects in mock data.
All related TypeScript errors were resolved.
