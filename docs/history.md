Description: Implemented a new feature to allow users to set a custom storage path for their todos and lists. This involved adding a new settings option in the UI, updating the Tauri backend to handle the custom path, and ensuring that data is correctly loaded from and saved to the specified location.
---

Date: 2024-05-11
Description: Added `notes`, `priority`, `dueDate`, and `dateOfCompletion` fields to the `Todo` interface and updated the application to support these new fields. This included modifying the `addTodo`, `toggleTodo`, and `editTodo` functions in `App.tsx`, as well as updating the `EditTodoDialog.tsx` component to include input fields for these new properties.

Date: 2025-05-11
Description: Refactored date fields (`dateCreated`, `dueDate`, `dateOfCompletion`) in the `Todo` interface from `string` to `Date` type for improved type safety and date manipulation.
Summary:
Changed the type of `dateCreated`, `dueDate`, and `dateOfCompletion` from `string` to `Date` in `src/types/todo.ts`.
Updated `src/App.tsx` to handle serialization (to ISO string for storage) and deserialization (from string to `Date` object on load) for these date fields. Ensured new todos and date updates use `Date` objects.
Modified `src/components/TodoItem.tsx` to correctly format `Date` objects for display using `date-fns`.
Adjusted `src/components/EditTodoDialog.tsx` to handle `Date` objects for `dueDate`, including formatting `Date` to string for the input field and parsing the input string back to a `Date` object on save.
Updated `src/components/TodoItem.test.tsx` to use `Date` objects in mock data.
All related TypeScript errors were resolved.

---

Date: 2025-05-11
Description: Added display of `dateOfCompletion` in the TodoItem component and made it responsive.
Summary:
Modified `src/components/TodoItem.tsx` to display the `dateOfCompletion` next to the `dateCreated`. The `dateOfCompletion` is only shown if the todo is marked as completed and the `dateOfCompletion` is set. The dates are displayed using flexbox with `justify-between` to position them on opposite sides on larger screens (sm and up), and stack vertically (`flex-col`) on smaller screens.

---

Date: 2025-05-11
Description: Fixed "Invalid time value" error in Edge browser using native JavaScript date handling.
Summary:
Removed `date-fns` dependency from `src/components/TodoItem.tsx`.
Implemented helper functions `isValidNativeDate` (using `d instanceof Date && !isNaN(d.getTime())`) and `formatNativeDate` (to format dates as "MMM d, yyyy - HH:mm") within `src/components/TodoItem.tsx`.
Updated the date display logic for `todo.dateCreated` and `todo.dateOfCompletion` to use these native helper functions. This resolves the `RangeError: Invalid time value` in Edge without external libraries.

---

Date: 2025-05-11
Description: Refactored helper functions into a separate file.
Summary: Created `src/utils/helper.ts` and moved `isValidNativeDate` and `formatNativeDate` functions from `src/components/TodoItem.tsx` to this new file. Updated `src/components/TodoItem.tsx` to import these functions from `src/utils/helper.ts`.

---

Date: 2025-05-11
Description: Refactored App.tsx to improve modularity and readability.
Summary:
Extracted UI sections from `App.tsx` into new, more focused components:

- `src/components/LoadingIndicator.tsx`: Displays a loading spinner.
- `src/components/SettingsView.tsx`: Renders the settings page content.
- `src/components/TodoForm.tsx`: Handles the form for adding new todos.
- `src/components/TodoListItems.tsx`: Renders the sortable list of todo items.
- `src/components/TodoListView.tsx`: Manages the main todo list view, incorporating `TodoForm` and `TodoListItems`.
  Moved several utility/helper functions from `App.tsx` to `src/utils/helper.ts`:
- `processLoadedLists`: Converts raw list data from storage into the `TodoList[]` format.
- `serializeListsForSave`: Prepares `TodoList[]` for saving by converting `Date` objects to ISO strings.
- `getFilteredTodos`: Computes the `filteredTodos` array based on the current `selectedList` and `hideCompleted` status.
- `calculateTodoCountByList`: Computes the `todoCountByList` object.
  Updated `App.tsx` to import and use these new components and helper functions, significantly reducing its size and complexity.

Date: 2025-05-11
Description: Fixed Framer Motion warning in TodoListItems component.
Summary:
Modified `src/components/TodoListItems.tsx` to correctly use `React.forwardRef`. This resolves the console warning "Warning: Function components cannot be given refs. Attempts to access this ref will fail. Did you mean to use React.forwardRef()?" that occurred when using `AnimatePresence` with `mode="popLayout"`. The component now properly forwards refs to the underlying `motion.div` element.

Date: 2025-05-11
Description: Fixed drag and drop error related to lazy loading.
Task Completed:
Changed the import of `TodoItem` in `src/App.tsx` from a lazy-loaded component (`React.lazy`) to a direct import. This resolves the "A component suspended while responding to synchronous input" error that occurred during drag-and-drop operations when `DragOverlay` attempted to render the lazy-loaded `TodoItem`.

---

Date: 2025-05-11
Description: Removed unused `isEditing` property from the Todo interface.
Task Completed:
Analyzed the codebase to determine where the `isEditing?: boolean;` property, defined in the `Todo` interface in `src/types/todo.ts`, is used. The analysis found no usages of this property. Consequently, the `isEditing` property was removed from the `Todo` interface in `src/types/todo.ts`.

---

Date: 2025-05-11
Description: Removed unused `editText` property from the Todo interface.
Task Completed:
Analyzed the codebase to determine where the `editText?: string;` property, defined in the `Todo` interface in `src/types/todo.ts`, is used. The analysis found no usages of this property. Consequently, the `editText` property was removed from the `Todo` interface in `src/types/todo.ts`.

---

Date: 2025-05-11
Description: Renamed 'text' field to 'title' in Todo interface and updated all references.

Description: Extracted ListItem component from Sidebar.
Task Completed:
Extracted the `ListItem` component and the `getIconForList` helper function from `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` into a new file `src/components/ListItem.tsx`. Updated `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` to remove the extracted code and import the `ListItem` component from the new file. This improves modularity by separating the list item rendering logic from the main sidebar component.

Summary of State Management Refactoring
I have successfully analyzed and refactored the application to use the global useTodoStore instead of local state and props throughout the application. Here's what was accomplished:

🔧 Store Enhancements
Extended todoStore.ts with new state and actions:

Form state: newTodo, setNewTodo
Edit dialog state: isEditDialogOpen, todoToEditDialog, setIsEditDialogOpen, setTodoToEditDialog
UI state: isSidebarOpen, sidebarWidth, windowWidth with corresponding setters
Drag & drop state: activeDraggedTodo, setActiveDraggedTodo
Helper functions: getCurrentList(), getFilteredTodos(), getTodoCountByList(), openEditDialog(), closeEditDialog(), addTodoFromForm()
List management: createList(), deleteList(), editList(), toggleSidebar()
📱 Component Refactoring

1. App.tsx

✅ Removed local state: newTodo, isEditDialogOpen, todoToEditDialog, isSidebarOpen, sidebarWidth, windowWidth, activeDraggedTodo
✅ Eliminated prop drilling by using store directly
✅ Simplified component by removing unnecessary functions (addTodo, handleOpenEditDialog, handleCloseEditDialog)
✅ Updated to use store's closeEditDialog() instead of local function 2. TodoListView.tsx

✅ Removed all props - now uses store directly
✅ Uses getFilteredTodos() from store instead of receiving filteredTodos prop
✅ Uses openEditDialog() from store instead of prop function
✅ Simplified component interface completely 3. TodoForm.tsx

✅ Removed all props (newTodo, setNewTodo, addTodo)
✅ Now uses newTodo, setNewTodo, and addTodoFromForm directly from store
✅ Completely self-contained component 4. Sidebar.tsx

✅ Completely refactored to use store instead of 12+ props
✅ Now uses store functions: createList(), deleteList(), editList(), toggleSidebar()
✅ Gets todoCountByList from store's getTodoCountByList()
✅ Removed local windowWidth state in favor of store's windowWidth
✅ Self-contained component with no external dependencies 5. EditTodoDialog.tsx

✅ Fixed type mismatch: changed id parameter from number to string

Description: Fixed Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) policy violation error when editing and saving lists.

**Problem:**
Users encountered a "new row violates row-level security policy for table 'lists'" error when trying to edit and save lists. The error occurred because the `saveLists` function was not properly setting the `user_id` field required by Supabase's RLS policies.

**Root Cause:**
The `saveLists` function was attempting to get the user ID from existing lists in the store (`get().lists.find((l) => l.id === list.id)?.userId`), which had several issues:

- For new lists, there was no existing list to get the userId from
- The userId field might be undefined or not properly set
- It was trying to get user info from local state instead of the authenticated user

**Solution:**

1. **Added auth store import** to todoStore.ts to access the current authenticated user
2. **Fixed saveLists function** to get the current user ID from the auth store instead of local state:
   ```typescript
   const currentUser = useAuthStore.getState().user;
   if (!currentUser) {
     throw new Error("User not authenticated");
   }
   // Now properly sets user_id: currentUser.id
   ```
3. **Fixed createList function** to properly set the user ID for new lists using the authenticated user
4. **Fixed fetchLists function** to properly map `user_id` from database to `userId` in the processed lists

**Benefits:**

- ✅ RLS Compliance: All list operations now properly include the authenticated user's ID
- ✅ Consistent User Association: All lists are properly associated with the current authenticated user
- ✅ Error Prevention: Added proper authentication checks to prevent operations when no user is authenticated
- ✅ Resolved the 403 Forbidden error when editing lists

**Files Modified:**

- `src/store/todoStore.ts`: Updated saveLists, createList, and fetchLists functions to properly handle user authentication

Description: Refactored todo application to separate list metadata from todos themselves, implementing a normalized data architecture.

**Problem:**
The application was using a denormalized data structure where each `TodoList` contained a `todos: Todo[]` array. This approach had several issues:

- Performance problems with large datasets
- Data duplication and inefficient memory usage
- Difficult maintenance and scalability concerns
- Complex state management when updating todos across lists

**Solution:**
Implemented a complete refactoring to separate lists and todos into independent collections with a normalized data architecture.

**Key Changes:**

1. **Modified Types (src/types/todo.ts)**

   - ✅ Removed `todos: Todo[]` field from `TodoList` interface
   - ✅ Maintained `Todo` interface with `listId` for relationship preservation

2. **Updated TodoStore State Structure (src/store/todoStore.ts)**

   - ✅ Added `todos: Todo[]` as separate state property
   - ✅ Added `setTodos` action for managing todos array
   - ✅ Added new functions: `fetchTodos`, `saveTodos`, `loadFromLocalStorage`

3. **Refactored Core Store Functions**

   - ✅ `fetchLists`: Now fetches only list metadata, calls `fetchTodos` separately
   - ✅ `fetchTodos`: New function to fetch todos separately from Supabase
   - ✅ `saveLists`: Now saves only list metadata (no todos)
   - ✅ `saveTodos`: New function to save todos separately to Supabase
   - ✅ `loadFromLocalStorage`: New function with migration support for old format

4. **Updated localStorage Handling**

   - ✅ Two separate keys: `"todo-lists"` for list metadata and `"todos"` for todo items
   - ✅ Migration logic: Automatically detects and converts old format to new format
   - ✅ Dual storage strategy: Maintains both Supabase and localStorage for fallback

5. **Updated All CRUD Operations**

   - ✅ `addTodo`: Works with separate `todos` array instead of `list.todos`
   - ✅ `toggleTodo`: Updated to find todos in the separate array
   - ✅ `deleteTodo`: Updated to filter from the separate todos array
   - ✅ `editTodo`: Updated to update todos in the separate array
   - ✅ `deleteList`: Now also deletes associated todos when a list is deleted

6. **Updated Helper Functions**

   - ✅ `getFilteredTodos`: Now filters todos by `listId` from the separate array
   - ✅ `getTodoCountByList`: Now counts todos from separate array grouped by `listId`

7. **Updated App.tsx**

   - ✅ Drag and Drop: Updated to work with the separate todos array
   - ✅ Import changes: Added `todos` and `saveTodos` from the store
   - ✅ Logic updates: All drag and drop operations now work with separate data structure

8. **Migration Strategy**
   - ✅ Backward compatibility: Detects old format data and automatically migrates
   - ✅ Seamless transition: Users with existing data have their data converted automatically
   - ✅ No data loss: Migration preserves all existing todos and lists

**Benefits Achieved:**

- 🚀 **Performance**: Normalized data structure reduces memory usage and improves rendering performance
- 🔧 **Maintainability**: Cleaner separation of concerns makes the code easier to maintain
- 📈 **Scalability**: Better handling of large datasets with separate collections
- 🔄 **Migration**: Seamless upgrade path for existing users
- 💾 **Storage**: More efficient localStorage usage with separate keys
- 🛡️ **Data Integrity**: Better relationship management between lists and todos

**Files Modified:**

- `src/types/todo.ts`: Removed todos array from TodoList interface
- `src/store/todoStore.ts`: Complete refactoring with separate collections and new functions
- `src/App.tsx`: Updated drag and drop logic to work with separate data structure

**Technical Implementation:**

- Maintained `listId` field in todos for relationship preservation
- Implemented automatic data migration from old to new format
- Added comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Preserved all existing functionality while improving underlying architecture

The refactoring is complete and the application now uses a normalized data architecture with separate collections for lists and todos, significantly improving performance and maintainability while preserving all existing functionality.

Description: Fixed window size saving functionality in Tauri v2 application to persist window dimensions across app restarts.

**Problem:**
The window size saving functionality was implemented but not working correctly. The config.json file was missing the `window_size` field, and window dimensions were not being saved when the user resized the window.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Backend Implementation**: The Rust backend had the `save_window_size` command and window resize event detection, but was emitting events to the frontend instead of saving directly
2. **Frontend Missing**: No frontend event listener was properly set up to receive the `save_window_size` events and call the Tauri command
3. **Event System Complexity**: The original approach relied on a complex event system between Rust and JavaScript that wasn't working reliably

**Solution:**
Implemented a **backend-only solution** that handles window size saving entirely in Rust without requiring any frontend changes.

**Key Changes:**

1. **Default Window Size (src-tauri/src/main.rs)**
   ```rust
   // Set window size from config if available, otherwise use default
   let window_size = config.window_size.unwrap_or(WindowSize {
       width: 1200.0,
       height: 800.0,
   });
   ```

2. **Direct Window Size Saving (src-tauri/src/main.rs)**
   ```rust
   // Listen for resize events and save directly
   window.on_window_event(move |event| {
       if let tauri::WindowEvent::Resized(_) = event {
           let size = window_clone.inner_size().unwrap();

           // Save window size directly
           let window_size = WindowSize {
               width: size.width as f64,
               height: size.height as f64,
           };

           // Load current config, update window size, and save
           match load_or_create_config() {
               Ok(mut config) => {
                   config.window_size = Some(window_size);
                   match save_config(&config) {
                       Ok(_) => println!("Window size saved successfully: {}x{}", size.width, size.height),
                       Err(e) => println!("Failed to save window size: {}", e),
                   }
               }
               Err(e) => println!("Failed to load config: {}", e),
           }
       }
   });
   ```

3. **Cleanup**
   - ✅ Removed unused `save_window_size` Tauri command
   - ✅ Removed frontend event listener code from App.tsx
   - ✅ Removed unused imports (`Emitter`, `isTauri`)

**Implementation Details:**

- **Window Size Structure**: Uses existing `WindowSize` struct with `width` and `height` as `f64`
- **Config Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing `AppConfig` structure
- **Default Behavior**: Sets default window size of 1200x800 when no saved size exists
- **Automatic Saving**: Every window resize event triggers an immediate save to config.json
- **Automatic Restoration**: Window size is restored from config.json on application startup

**Benefits:**

- 🚀 **Reliability**: Backend-only solution eliminates frontend event listener complexity
- 🔧 **Simplicity**: No frontend changes required, purely Tauri backend implementation
- 💾 **Persistence**: Window size persists across application restarts
- 🛡️ **Fallback**: Uses sensible defaults (1200x800) when no saved size exists
- ⚡ **Performance**: Direct saving without event system overhead

**Testing Results:**

- ✅ Window size is saved to config.json on every resize
- ✅ Window size is restored correctly on application restart
- ✅ Default size (1200x800) is applied when no saved size exists
- ✅ Config.json now contains: `{"storage_path":"","theme":"dark","window_size":{"width":1433.0,"height":865.0}}`

**Files Modified:**

- `src-tauri/src/main.rs`: Implemented direct window size saving in resize event handler, added default window size, removed unused command
- `src/App.tsx`: Removed frontend event listener code and unused imports

**Technical Implementation:**

The solution leverages Tauri's native window event system (`window.on_window_event`) to detect resize events and directly saves the window size to the config file using the existing `load_or_create_config()` and `save_config()` functions. This approach is more reliable than the previous event-based system and requires no frontend coordination.

Description: Extracted drag and drop functionality into a custom hook to improve App.tsx modularity and readability.

**Problem:**
The App.tsx file contained complex drag and drop logic (handleDragStart and handleDragEnd functions) that made the component large and harder to maintain. The drag and drop handlers were tightly coupled with the main component logic.

**Solution:**
Created a custom React hook `useDragAndDrop` following React best practices to encapsulate all drag and drop functionality.

**Key Changes:**

1. **Created Custom Hook (src/hooks/useDragAndDrop.ts)**
   - ✅ Extracted `handleDragStart` and `handleDragEnd` functions from App.tsx
   - ✅ Encapsulated all drag and drop logic including:
     - Todo reordering within the same list using `arrayMove`
     - Moving todos between different lists
     - Special handling for "All" and "Completed" lists
     - Completion status updates when moving to/from "Completed" list
   - ✅ Uses `useTodoStore` to access necessary state and actions
   - ✅ Returns handlers object for use with DndContext

2. **Simplified App.tsx**
   - ✅ Removed inline drag handlers (82+ lines of code)
   - ✅ Added `useDragAndDrop` hook import and usage
   - ✅ Removed unused imports: `DragStartEvent`, `DragEndEvent`, `arrayMove`
   - ✅ Cleaned up store destructuring to only include needed properties
   - ✅ Maintained all existing functionality while reducing component complexity

3. **Followed React Best Practices**
   - ✅ Named hook with "use" prefix following React conventions
   - ✅ Encapsulated related logic in a single, focused hook
   - ✅ Made the hook reusable and testable
   - ✅ Improved separation of concerns

**Benefits:**

- 🚀 **Modularity**: Drag and drop logic is now isolated and reusable
- 🔧 **Maintainability**: App.tsx is significantly smaller and more focused
- 📖 **Readability**: Complex drag logic is abstracted away from the main component
- 🧪 **Testability**: Drag and drop logic can be tested independently
- 🎯 **Single Responsibility**: App.tsx focuses on layout and routing, hook handles drag operations
- ♻️ **Reusability**: Hook can be easily reused in other components if needed

**Files Modified:**

- `src/hooks/useDragAndDrop.ts`: New custom hook containing all drag and drop logic
- `src/App.tsx`: Simplified by removing inline handlers and using the custom hook

**Technical Implementation:**

The custom hook follows React's custom hook patterns by:
- Using the "use" prefix for proper naming convention
- Calling other hooks (useTodoStore) at the top level
- Returning an object with handler functions for external use
- Encapsulating all related state and logic in one place

This refactoring maintains 100% of the existing drag and drop functionality while significantly improving code organization and maintainability.

Description: Improved drag and drop collision detection for desktop screens with focused enhancements.

**Problem:**
After attempting comprehensive mobile improvements that broke drag and drop functionality, reverted changes and focused specifically on desktop screen improvements. The original issue was that drag hover detection varied between screen sizes, with some inconsistency in when drop zones would activate.

**Solution:**
Implemented targeted desktop-focused improvements with minimal changes to maintain stability while enhancing the user experience.

**Key Changes:**

1. **Enhanced Collision Detection (src/App.tsx)**
   - ✅ Changed from `closestCenter` to `closestCorners` collision detection
   - ✅ Provides more reliable drop zone detection without breaking existing functionality
   - ✅ Better corner-based detection for rectangular drop zones

2. **Improved Visual Feedback (src/components/ListItem.tsx)**
   - ✅ Enhanced hover state with scale animation (`scale-105`) and shadow (`shadow-md`)
   - ✅ Changed transition from `transition-colors` to `transition-all duration-200` for smoother animations
   - ✅ Maintained all existing styling while adding subtle visual enhancements

**Benefits:**

- 🖥️ **Desktop-Optimized**: Focused improvements specifically for desktop drag and drop experience
- 🎯 **Better Detection**: `closestCorners` provides more reliable collision detection than `closestCenter`
- 🎨 **Enhanced Feedback**: Subtle scale and shadow effects provide clear visual feedback during drag operations
- ⚡ **Stable**: Minimal changes ensure existing functionality remains intact
- 🔄 **Smooth Animations**: Improved transitions for better user experience

**Technical Implementation:**

- **Collision Detection**: `closestCorners` algorithm provides better detection for rectangular drop zones compared to center-based detection
- **Visual Enhancements**: Added scale and shadow effects only during drag hover state
- **Smooth Transitions**: Enhanced CSS transitions for all properties with 200ms duration

**Files Modified:**

- `src/App.tsx`: Updated collision detection import and usage
- `src/components/ListItem.tsx`: Enhanced visual feedback and transitions

**Testing Results:**

- ✅ Drag and drop functionality maintained and working properly
- ✅ Better visual feedback during drag operations
- ✅ Improved collision detection for desktop screens
- ✅ Smooth animations and transitions
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

This focused approach maintains stability while providing meaningful improvements to the desktop drag and drop experience.

Description: Enhanced drag and drop detection for different screen sizes with adaptive collision detection strategy.

**Problem:**
After the initial desktop improvements, drag and drop detection was still inconsistent across different screen sizes. On 2K screens, detection worked well and activated early, but on Full HD and smaller screens, the drop zones required precise positioning (almost covering the list item) before detecting hover.

**Root Cause:**
The sidebar width varies significantly between screen sizes, making the effective drop zone area much smaller on smaller screens. The `closestCorners` collision detection was still too restrictive for narrower sidebars.

**Solution:**
Implemented an adaptive collision detection strategy that uses different algorithms based on screen width, combined with extended drop zones for better targeting.

**Key Changes:**

1. **Adaptive Collision Detection (src/App.tsx)**
   ```typescript
   // Custom collision detection that's more forgiving on smaller screens
   const customCollisionDetection: CollisionDetection = (args) => {
     // On smaller screens (narrower sidebar), use more forgiving rectangle intersection
     if (windowWidth < 1600) {
       const rectCollisions = rectIntersection(args);
       if (rectCollisions.length > 0) {
         return rectCollisions;
       }
     }

     // Fall back to corner-based detection for larger screens or when rect intersection fails
     return closestCorners(args);
   };
   ```

2. **Extended Drop Zones (src/components/ListItem.tsx)**
   - ✅ Wrapped button in a container div with the droppable reference
   - ✅ Added padding (`p-1 -m-1`) to extend the effective drop zone area
   - ✅ Moved hover styling to the container for better visual feedback
   - ✅ Maintained button functionality while expanding the drop target

**Benefits:**

- 📏 **Screen-Adaptive**: Uses `rectIntersection` for screens < 1600px width, `closestCorners` for larger screens
- 🎯 **Better Targeting**: Extended drop zones make it easier to target list items on smaller screens
- 🖥️ **Optimized Detection**: Different collision algorithms optimized for different screen sizes
- 🎨 **Consistent Feedback**: Visual hover effects work consistently across all screen sizes
- ⚡ **Performance**: Efficient fallback strategy ensures reliable detection

**Technical Implementation:**

- **Screen Width Threshold**: Uses 1600px as the breakpoint between collision detection strategies
- **Rectangle Intersection**: More forgiving algorithm for smaller screens with narrower sidebars
- **Extended Drop Zones**: Container-based drop zones with padding to increase effective area
- **Fallback Strategy**: Ensures detection works even if primary algorithm fails

**Files Modified:**

- `src/App.tsx`: Added adaptive collision detection based on screen width
- `src/components/ListItem.tsx`: Extended drop zones with container wrapper and padding

**Testing Results:**

- ✅ Improved detection on Full HD and smaller screens
- ✅ Maintains precise detection on larger screens (2K+)
- ✅ Extended drop zones make targeting easier
- ✅ Consistent visual feedback across all screen sizes
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

This adaptive approach provides optimal drag and drop experience across all desktop screen sizes while maintaining the enhanced visual feedback.
