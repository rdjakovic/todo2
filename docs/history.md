Description: Implemented a new feature to allow users to set a custom storage path for their todos and lists. This involved adding a new settings option in the UI, updating the Tauri backend to handle the custom path, and ensuring that data is correctly loaded from and saved to the specified location.

Description: Added `notes`, `priority`, `dueDate`, and `dateOfCompletion` fields to the `Todo` interface and updated the application to support these new fields. This included modifying the `addTodo`, `toggleTodo`, and `editTodo` functions in `App.tsx`, as well as updating the `EditTodoDialog.tsx` component to include input fields for these new properties.

Description: Set up the BrowserTools MCP server. Performed an initial audit of the application, identifying areas for SEO and performance improvement. Implemented Phase 1 SEO fixes (added meta description and robots.txt), raising SEO score to 100. Implemented Phase 2 performance optimizations (configured asset compression, bundle visualization, and lazy-loaded EditTodoDialog and TodoItem components), resulting in a reduced main JavaScript bundle size.

Description: Refactored date fields (`dateCreated`, `dueDate`, `dateOfCompletion`) in the `Todo` interface from `string` to `Date` type for improved type safety and date manipulation.
Summary:
Changed the type of `dateCreated`, `dueDate`, and `dateOfCompletion` from `string` to `Date` in `src/types/todo.ts`.
Updated `src/App.tsx` to handle serialization (to ISO string for storage) and deserialization (from string to `Date` object on load) for these date fields. Ensured new todos and date updates use `Date` objects.
Modified `src/components/TodoItem.tsx` to correctly format `Date` objects for display using `date-fns`.
Adjusted `src/components/EditTodoDialog.tsx` to handle `Date` objects for `dueDate`, including formatting `Date` to string for the input field and parsing the input string back to a `Date` object on save.
Updated `src/components/TodoItem.test.tsx` to use `Date` objects in mock data.
All related TypeScript errors were resolved.

Description: Added display of `dateOfCompletion` in the TodoItem component and made it responsive.
Summary:
Modified `src/components/TodoItem.tsx` to display the `dateOfCompletion` next to the `dateCreated`. The `dateOfCompletion` is only shown if the todo is marked as completed and the `dateOfCompletion` is set. The dates are displayed using flexbox with `justify-between` to position them on opposite sides on larger screens (sm and up), and stack vertically (`flex-col`) on smaller screens.

Description: Fixed "Invalid time value" error in Edge browser using native JavaScript date handling.
Summary:
Removed `date-fns` dependency from `src/components/TodoItem.tsx`.
Implemented helper functions `isValidNativeDate` (using `d instanceof Date && !isNaN(d.getTime())`) and `formatNativeDate` (to format dates as "MMM d, yyyy - HH:mm") within `src/components/TodoItem.tsx`.
Updated the date display logic for `todo.dateCreated` and `todo.dateOfCompletion` to use these native helper functions. This resolves the `RangeError: Invalid time value` in Edge without external libraries.

---

Date: 2025-05-11
Description: Refactored helper functions into a separate file.
Summary: Created `src/utils/helper.ts` and moved `isValidNativeDate` and `formatNativeDate` functions from `src/components/TodoItem.tsx` to this new file. Updated `src/components/TodoItem.tsx` to import these functions from `src/utils/helper.ts`.

Date: 2025-05-11
Description: Refactored App.tsx to improve modularity and readability.
Summary:
Extracted UI sections from `App.tsx` into new, more focused components:

- `src/components/LoadingIndicator.tsx`: Displays a loading spinner.
- `src/components/SettingsView.tsx`: Renders the settings page content.
- `src/components/TodoForm.tsx`: Handles the form for adding new todos.
- `src/components/TodoListItems.tsx`: Renders the sortable list of todo items.
- `src/components/TodoListView.tsx`: Manages the main todo list view, incorporating `TodoForm` and `TodoListItems`.
  Moved several utility/helper functions from `App.tsx` to `src/utils/helper.ts`:
- `processLoadedLists`: Converts raw list data from storage into the `TodoList[]` format.
- `serializeListsForSave`: Prepares `TodoList[]` for saving by converting `Date` objects to ISO strings.
- `getFilteredTodos`: Computes the `filteredTodos` array based on the current `selectedList` and `hideCompleted` status.
- `calculateTodoCountByList`: Computes the `todoCountByList` object.
  Updated `App.tsx` to import and use these new components and helper functions, significantly reducing its size and complexity.

Description: Fixed Framer Motion warning in TodoListItems component.
Summary:
Modified `src/components/TodoListItems.tsx` to correctly use `React.forwardRef`. This resolves the console warning "Warning: Function components cannot be given refs. Attempts to access this ref will fail. Did you mean to use React.forwardRef()?" that occurred when using `AnimatePresence` with `mode="popLayout"`. The component now properly forwards refs to the underlying `motion.div` element.

Description: Fixed drag and drop error related to lazy loading.
Task Completed:
Changed the import of `TodoItem` in `src/App.tsx` from a lazy-loaded component (`React.lazy`) to a direct import. This resolves the "A component suspended while responding to synchronous input" error that occurred during drag-and-drop operations when `DragOverlay` attempted to render the lazy-loaded `TodoItem`.

Date: 2025-05-11
Description: Removed unused `isEditing` property from the Todo interface.
Task Completed:
Analyzed the codebase to determine where the `isEditing?: boolean;` property, defined in the `Todo` interface in `src/types/todo.ts`, is used. The analysis found no usages of this property. Consequently, the `isEditing` property was removed from the `Todo` interface in `src/types/todo.ts`.

---

Date: 2025-05-11
Description: Removed unused `editText` property from the Todo interface.
Task Completed:
Analyzed the codebase to determine where the `editText?: string;` property, defined in the `Todo` interface in `src/types/todo.ts`, is used. The analysis found no usages of this property. Consequently, the `editText` property was removed from the `Todo` interface in `src/types/todo.ts`.

Description: Renamed 'text' field to 'title' in Todo interface and updated all references.
Task Completed:
Renamed the `text` field to `title` in the `Todo` interface in `src/types/todo.ts`.
Updated all references to this field in the following files:

- `src/App.tsx`: Changed `text` to `title` in `addTodo`, `editTodo`, and `handleSaveEditDialog`.
- `src/components/TodoItem.tsx`: Changed `todo.text` to `todo.title` for displaying the todo.
- `src/components/EditTodoDialog.tsx`: Changed `newText` to `newTitle` in `onSave` prop and updated `todoToEdit.text` to `todoToEdit.title` in `useEffect`.
- `src/components/TodoItem.test.tsx`: Changed `text` to `title` in `mockTodo`.
  All TypeScript errors related to this change were resolved.

Description: Extracted ListItem component from Sidebar.
Task Completed:
Extracted the `ListItem` component and the `getIconForList` helper function from `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` into a new file `src/components/ListItem.tsx`. Updated `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` to remove the extracted code and import the `ListItem` component from the new file. This improves modularity by separating the list item rendering logic from the main sidebar component.
