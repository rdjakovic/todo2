Key Security Areas Identified
Based on my analysis of the codebase, the spec addresses critical security concerns including:

Authentication vulnerabilities - Session management, token handling, logout processes
Data exposure risks - IndexedDB storage, local data encryption, user isolation
Frontend attack vectors - XSS, input validation, CSP implementation
Backend security gaps - RLS policies, API authorization, error handling
Desktop-specific risks - Tauri IPC security, file system access, privilege escalation
Configuration issues - Environment variables, CSP disabled, build security
Dependency vulnerabilities - Third-party library security, update management
The spec is now ready for execution. You can begin implementing the security analysis by opening the tasks.md file and clicking "Start task" next to any task item to begin the comprehensive security assessment of your Todo2 application.
