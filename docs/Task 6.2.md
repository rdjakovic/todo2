Task 6.2 Complete!
I've created a comprehensive privilege escalation testing script that demonstrates the key vulnerabilities identified in your security analysis. Here's what the script tests:

Key Vulnerability Tests:
Directory Traversal Attack - Tests path traversal using ../../../ patterns to access system directories
Arbitrary File System Access - Attempts to access sensitive directories like /etc, /home, Windows system folders
Configuration Tampering - Tests theme manipulation and storage path configuration attacks
State Manipulation - Tests race conditions and state persistence vulnerabilities
Path Traversal in File Operations - Tests unsafe path construction in file operations
Symbolic Link Attack - Tests following symbolic links to sensitive files (Unix systems)
Resource Exhaustion - Tests file size limits and rapid operation handling
Script Features:
Comprehensive Testing: Covers all major privilege escalation vectors from your analysis
Cross-Platform: Handles Windows and Unix-like systems appropriately
Detailed Logging: Tracks all test results with timestamps and details
Security Scoring: Provides an overall security assessment score
Manual/Auto Execution: Can run all tests or individual test suites
Export Functionality: Results can be exported for further analysis
Usage:
The script can be loaded in the Tauri application's webview and executed via:

securityTests.runAll() - Run complete test suite
securityTests.[testName]() - Run specific tests
securityTests.results - View detailed results
securityTests.generateReport() - Generate summary report
Safety Features:
All tests are non-destructive and designed for security assessment
Clear warnings about testing environment requirements
Detailed error handling and result categorization
Platform-specific test adaptations
This script will help demonstrate the critical vulnerabilities you identified, particularly the arbitrary file system access, path traversal issues, and lack of proper sandboxing in the Todo2 application. The results will provide concrete evidence for your security recommendations.

🔒 Setting up Privilege Escalation Security Tests
==================================================

🧪 Executing security tests...

To run the privilege escalation tests:

1. The Tauri application should now be running
2. Open the application window
3. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
4. Go to the Console tab
5. Copy and paste the following commands:

// Load the test script
fetch('/security-reports/privilege-escalation-test-script.js')
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(script => {
    eval(script);
    console.log('Security test script loaded');
  });

// Run all tests
securityTests.runAll();

// Or run individual tests:
securityTests.directoryTraversal();
securityTests.arbitraryFileAccess();
securityTests.configurationTampering();
securityTests.stateManipulation();
securityTests.pathTraversal();
securityTests.symbolicLinkAttack();
securityTests.resourceExhaustion();

// View results
securityTests.results;

// Export results
securityTests.export();

ALTERNATIVE METHOD:
Open the test interface by navigating to:
file://C:\playground\Tauri\todo2\src\security\privilege-escalation-test.html

✅ Privilege escalation test setup completed

🚀 To run the privilege escalation tests:

1. Start the Tauri application:
   npm run tauri dev

2. Open the application and press F12 to open Developer Tools

3. In the Console tab, run:
   // Load the test script
   const script = document.createElement("script");
   script.src = "../security-reports/privilege-escalation-test-script.js";
   document.head.appendChild(script);

4. After the script loads, run all tests:
   securityTests.runAll();

5. Or run individual tests:
   securityTests.directoryTraversal();
   securityTests.arbitraryFileAccess();
   securityTests.configurationTampering();

6. View results:
   securityTests.results;

7. Export results:
   securityTests.export();

📋 Alternative: Open the test interface at:
   file://C:\playground\Tauri\todo2\src\security\privilege-escalation-test.html

⚠️  Remember: Only run these tests in a controlled environment!
